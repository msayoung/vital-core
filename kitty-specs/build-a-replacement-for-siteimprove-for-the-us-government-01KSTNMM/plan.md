# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]
*Path: [templates/plan-template.md](templates/plan-template.md)*


**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/kitty-specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/spec-kitty.plan` command. See `src/specify_cli/missions/software-dev/command-templates/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

The planner will not begin until all planning questions have been answered—capture those answers in this document before progressing to later phases.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

Language/Version: TypeScript / Node.js
Primary Dependencies: axe-core, Lighthouse, Playwright or Chromium tooling, SQLite, Wappalyzer-related detection
Storage: SQLite database plus JSON/CSV/Markdown/static HTML outputs under dist/
Testing: npm test, unit tests under tests/unit, smoke tests under tests/smoke
Target Platform: Node.js CLI and GitHub Actions recurring scan pipeline
Project Type: single TypeScript project
Primary User Value: weekly report showing accessibility and quality regressions, improvements, priority issues, affected pages, and exportable evidence


## Charter Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

[Gates determined based on charter file]

  for this feature. Delete unused options and expand the chosen structure with
  real paths (e.g., apps/admin, packages/something). The delivered plan must
  not include Option labels.

## Complexity Tracking

*Fill ONLY if Charter Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
