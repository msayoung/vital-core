# Vital Core Runtime Charter

This project builds a government web quality scanner and weekly reporting
surface. The charter binds agents to the repository's public authority in
[AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md), [ACCESSIBILITY.md](../../ACCESSIBILITY.md), and
[README.md](../../README.md).

## Purpose

Produce reproducible accessibility and performance reports that help teams
track week-over-week change, preserve historical evidence, and prioritize
remediation work on government sites.

## Binding Directives

| Directive | Requirement |
| --- | --- |
| weekly-accessibility-tracking | Prefer weekly comparisons, regressions, and recovery trends over isolated single-run output. |
| stable-page-identity | Keep URL and page identity stable so records dedupe cleanly across weeks. |
| historical-evidence-preservation | Treat summaries as durable history; prune only page-level detail after retention rules allow it. |
| accessible-reporting | Generated HTML must be semantic, keyboard-usable, and provide text alternatives for charts and other visualizations. |
| efficient-recurring-scans | Keep scans deterministic, rate-controlled, and proportionate to the site's value and weekly budget. |

## Testing and Quality

- Validation is required before merge: `spec-kitty upgrade --agent-check --json`,
  `spec-kitty agent config sync --create-missing`, `spec-kitty doctor skills --json`,
  `spec-kitty charter preflight --json`, `npm run check:spec-kitty`, YAML parse,
  `git diff --check`, and `npm run test:unit`.
- Reports must stay accessible without JavaScript and remain readable in
  light and dark themes.
- Automated scan results are a floor, not a release gate by themselves; manual
  review remains necessary for real accessibility confidence.

## Deployment and Branching

- GitHub is the source of truth.
- Hugging Face is a deployment target only and is updated through the `hf`
  remote and the publishing scripts, not by treating a Hugging Face branch as
  the canonical branch.
- Generated reports and weekly data must remain reproducible from the committed
  repository state.
