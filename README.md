# VITAL Scans

An open source website quality engine. It crawls 5–20 domains slowly and
politely across each week, scans thousands of pages per domain with
[axe-core](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core) and
[Siteimprove Alfa](https://github.com/Siteimprove/alfa) (the open source
engine behind Siteimprove's commercial checker), measures page weight,
estimated energy costs, image inventory, and technology stack, and publishes
week-over-week reports to GitHub Pages. Everything runs on GitHub Actions.
There is no server, no database, and no budget line.

Continuous measurement beats one-off audits. The question this answers is
not "is this site accessible?" but "is this site **getting more
accessible** to more people?"

## Design principles

**Files are the only state. Data is append-only. Reports are pure
functions of the data directory.**

- `state/<domain>/crawl.json`: the crawl frontier. The only mutable
  file. If it is deleted, the crawler reseeds from the sitemap and no
  history is lost.
- `data/<domain>/<ISO-week>/pages/*.json`: one compact record per page
  per week. Append-only.
- `data/<domain>/<ISO-week>/runs/*.json`: append-only run logs.
- `data/<domain>/<ISO-week>/summary.json`: the weekly rollup, computed
  from the page records and committed. Old page-level detail is pruned
  after `retention_weeks`; summaries are kept forever, so trend history
  never breaks.
- `docs/`: generated HTML, built at deploy time and shipped as a Pages
  artifact. **Never committed.** It cannot drift from the data because
  it does not persist.

Other deliberate choices:

- **Stable page identity.** One URL normalization function
  (`src/lib/urls.js`) defines page identity everywhere. Week-over-week
  comparison depends on it; treat it as a frozen contract.
- **ISO weeks as the unit of comparison.** A page scanned Tuesday and a
  page scanned Saturday of the same week belong to the same dataset.
  There are no synthesized run IDs to group incorrectly.
- **Pages-affected over instance counts.** A rule failing 600 times on
  a nav menu is one fix, not 600. Reports rank rules by pages affected.
- **A settle delay before auditing** (`settle_delay_ms`, overridable
  with `VITAL_A11Y_SETTLE_DELAY_MS`) lets client-side hydration finish,
  which removes the largest source of transient false positives.
- **URL path/query filtering.** Per-target `url_include` / `url_exclude`
  substring arrays (set in `config/targets.yml`) narrow which pages are
  crawled and scanned. Priority URLs always bypass the filter.
- **Plain Node, no build step, no TypeScript, six dependencies.** Less
  machinery to break in CI.

## How a week works

1. The `scan` workflow runs nightly at off-hours (UTC crons in
   `.github/workflows/scan.yml`; adjust for your targets' audiences).
2. Each run scans up to `pages_per_run` pages per domain that have not
   yet been scanned this ISO week, discovering new same-host links as it
   goes. Coverage accumulates: 300 pages/run × 7 runs ≈ 2,000+
   pages/domain/week, within the `max_pages_per_week` cap.
3. After the night's scans finish, the `report` workflow aggregates the
   week, deploys the reports to GitHub Pages, and prunes page-level
   detail older than `retention_weeks`.

**[ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md)**.

## Setup

### Repository Roles

GitHub is the source of truth for this project. The `main` branch keeps
the full working history, and that is where development should land.
Hugging Face Spaces is a deployment target, not a second source branch:
it should receive a clean snapshot of the current site state on its own
`main` branch, with large `state/` crawl artifacts stripped out before
push.

That split keeps the weekly reporting history intact on GitHub while
making the Space easier to understand and easier to rebuild. It also
means we do not need legacy branch names like `copilot/main-old` as part
of the long-term workflow.

1. Create a repository from these files and push to GitHub.
2. Edit `config/targets.yml`: list your 5–10 domains and adjust budgets.
3. In repository **Settings → Pages**, set the source to **GitHub
   Actions**.
4. In **Settings → Actions → General**, allow workflows **read and
   write permissions**.
5. Run the `scan` workflow once manually (Actions → scan → Run
   workflow) to verify, then run `report` to publish the first reports.

## Local use

```sh
npm ci
npx playwright install chromium
node src/scan.js --domain example.gov --budget 25
node src/aggregate.js
npx http-server docs   # or open docs/index.html
```

Tests:

```sh
npm run test:unit   # URL identity, ISO weeks, robots.txt, batch picking
npm run test:e2e    # full pipeline over a local fixture site simulating two weeks
```

## Languages

Reports can be published in multiple languages. Set `languages` (and optionally
`default_language`) in `config/targets.yml` — globally or per target, e.g.
`languages: [en, fr]` for a Canadian site. The default language keeps the usual
file paths; every other language is published alongside as `<page>-<lang>.html`,
cross-linked by a header language switcher that works without JavaScript.

Translation uses a Drupal/gettext-style `t()` where the English phrase is the
key, so untranslated strings fall back to English and partial catalogs are safe.
Catalogs are human-reviewed JSON in `src/locales/<lang>.json` (`en`, `fr`, `ja`,
`nl` supported). Run `npm run i18n:extract` to refresh the translator checklist
(`src/locales/template.json`). Only the UI chrome is translated — engine-sourced
WCAG/rule descriptions stay English. See CLAUDE.md for details.

## Politeness

The crawler honors `robots.txt` (Disallow/Allow/Crawl-delay),
identifies itself with a user agent containing a contact URL, scans one
page at a time per domain with a configurable delay, and runs at night.
If you operate a site being scanned and want changes, open an issue.

## Honest limits

- Automated checkers find roughly 30–40% of WCAG barriers. A clean
  report is a floor, not a finish line. Manual testing with assistive
  technology remains essential. Testing with users with disabilities throughout the design stage. Using a well supported design system is key to learning from past mistakes.
- Byte counts are decoded body sizes seen by the browser, not on-wire
  transfer sizes. They are consistent week over week, which is what the
  trend needs.
- Technology detection (Wappalyzer) fingerprints client-side signals and
  is not authoritative; confidence scores reflect this.

## Commitments

This project follows public commitments to
[accessibility](ACCESSIBILITY.md) and
[sustainability](SUSTAINABILITY.md), and aims to advance the
[W3C Web Sustainability Guidelines](https://w3c.github.io/sustainableweb-wsg/).
The reports themselves are part of the argument: semantic HTML, no
web fonts, ~2 KB of CSS, dark mode respected. They work fully without
JavaScript — every chart renders as a static SVG with a data-table
fallback. Where JavaScript is available, charts are progressively
enhanced into interactive, keyboard- and screen-reader-navigable
[ParaCharts](https://github.com/fizzstudio/ParaCharts), vendored and
served first-party (no CDN).
