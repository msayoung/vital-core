# CLAUDE.md — vital-core

Instructions for Claude Code when working in this repository.

---

## Project overview

vital-core crawls government websites with Playwright/Chromium, runs
axe-core + Siteimprove Alfa accessibility audits plus a suite of
sustainability/standards engines, and publishes static HTML reports to
GitHub Pages via `docs/` (generated; gitignored locally, deployed as
a GitHub Actions artifact).

**Stack**: Node.js ESM ≥20, no build step, no bundler.

**Key commands**:
```bash
npm run scan          # crawl + audit one target (VITAL_DOMAIN=www.cms.gov)
npm run aggregate     # build docs/ from data/
npm run test:unit     # 91 unit tests (Node built-in runner)
npm run test:e2e      # smoke test
npm run check:public-interest www.cms.gov   # quick 4-check diagnostic
```

## Spec Kitty workflow

This project uses [Spec Kitty](https://spec-kitty.dev) as its AI-agent
orchestration layer. Every non-trivial feature goes through a mission.

### Session start

At the start of any implementation session, run these two commands and
include both outputs in your first message:

```bash
# 1. Check current mission state (what step is next)
spec-kitty next --mission <slug>

# 2. Get the structured prompt for that step
spec-kitty agent context resolve --action tasks --mission <slug>
```

For a mission that already has a plan and work packages, substitute
`tasks` with `implement` and add `--wp-id WP01` (etc.).

### Workflow

```
specify → fill spec.md → plan → implement (WP by WP) → accept → merge
```

1. `spec-kitty specify <feature-name>` — creates `kitty-specs/<mission>/`
2. Edit `kitty-specs/<mission>/spec.md` with concrete acceptance criteria
   (the "what", not the "how")
3. `spec-kitty plan --mission <slug>` — scaffolds ordered work packages
4. Implement one work package per Claude session; commit when done
5. `spec-kitty accept --mission <slug>` — gate before opening a PR
6. PR targets `main`; after merge the branch is deleted

### Spec hygiene

- When you complete an acceptance criterion, add a ✓ beside it in `spec.md`.
- When you discover a criterion is wrong or superseded, update it in-place
  rather than leaving stale text.
- Before opening a PR, run `spec-kitty upgrade --dry-run` to catch drift.
- Never put implementation plans in `spec.md` — those belong in `plan.md`.

---

## Security rules (non-negotiable)

- **Never commit `.env`** — it contains `HF_TOKEN`.
- **VA domains are `hf_only: true`** — they must never run in GitHub Actions.
  The `.filter(t => !t.hf_only)` guard in `scan.yml` is the enforcement point.
- **VA `data/` and `state/` paths are gitignored** — Playwright may capture
  CSRF/OAuth tokens on those pages. The gitignore entries are the only defense.

## Severity taxonomy

Use axe-core's four labels **verbatim**. Never use High / Medium / Low.

| Label | axe impact |
|---|---|
| Critical | critical |
| Serious | serious |
| Moderate | moderate |
| Minor | minor |

---

## VITAL default view

Shown by default = WCAG A/AA issues that are Critical or Serious (any page
count), OR Moderate/Minor with ≥10 pages affected. Best Practice is always
hidden by default. "Show everything" toggle reveals all.

Priority tiers: 0 = Critical/Serious + WCAG A/AA; 1 = Critical/Serious +
BP/Undetermined; 2 = Moderate/Minor + WCAG A/AA + ≥10 pages; 5 = hidden.

---

## Code conventions

- **CSS changes**: edit the CSS string constant inside `src/report-html.js`.
  Never edit `docs/style.css` — it is gitignored generated output.
- **Engine modules**: `src/engines/<name>.js`. Wire into `src/scan.js`
  (runs per-page or per-origin) and `src/aggregate.js` (rolls up).
- **Sampling rate**: add a line to `config/targets.yml` under `sampling:`.
- **Numeric columns in HTML tables**: `<th class="num">` and `<td class="num">`
  right-align values. Sortable buttons inside `th.num` need `text-align: right`.
- **Download filenames**: `<domain>_<DDMONYYYY>_<type>.<ext>` via
  `filePrefix(domain, week)` in `src/lib/csv.js`.
- **No comments** explaining what code does — only comment when the *why*
  is non-obvious (hidden constraint, workaround, subtle invariant).

---

## Testing

- Unit tests live in `tests/unit/**/*.test.js`.
- All 91 unit tests must pass before any PR is merged.
- No mocking of the database or filesystem in unit tests — use the real
  module APIs with small synthetic inputs.
- Run `npm run test:unit` after every change that touches `src/lib/`.

---

## PR discipline

- Branch off `main`, PR targets `main`.
- Push to the feature branch when work is ready for review — the user tests
  against `main` after merge, so merge before asking them to validate.
- Never force-push to `main`.
- Never use `--no-verify` to skip hooks.
